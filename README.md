# TheGreatAdventure

## Description
The great adventure is an RPG with a comba system.  
It's process is quite simplistic as you are offered choices and you answer in command line.  
There are no GUI and everything from dialogues to fights appens in your CLI.
The game offer a short story but an unlimited play time as ennemies grow with you and you can always keep fighting them.
This project was made during my last year of highschool and does not respect any kind of code template nor clealiness.  
The game is in French as I myself is french.  
Equilibrium wasn't part of the prerequisites so yeah, it's not very balanced either, maybe one day I'll patch this little project of mine.

## How to launch
Copy the repository on your computer  
Install python if not alreay done  
Run the script.py file with it  
Enjoy the game !
